#
# - A list of origins consisting of zero or more origins that are allowed access to the resource.
# - A list of methods consisting of zero or more methods that are supported by the resource.
# - A list of headers consisting of zero or more header field names that are supported by the resource.
# - A supports credentials flag that indicates whether the resource supports user credentials
#   in the request. It is true when the resource does and false otherwise.
